What to do for this folder and research today in general : TODO: 

1. finish the pipeline and make sure it actually works fine here 
2. get all of the cluster numbering for Russ and what not 
3. then work on the mosquito project and understand any questions i would need to ask

how to make the pipeline work? 
1. use python for file reading or args but file reading first (this is for ERS)
2. it runs into the assembly.slurm file up to the clustering part 
3. then python to read another file and run the other assembly for the actual breakpoint 
4. then i should be done and confirm it from there
